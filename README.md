## Description

This application is a backend service for an e-commerce site powered by Express.js and MySQL. The application can handle CRUD operations for organizing products, categories and tags. This app can be useful for anyone that needs a backend inventory system that can be agnostic to the front end through the use of RESTful APIs.

## Installation

To install the app a user needs to install node.js and run “npm install” from the cloned repository.

## Usage

The user is required to have a MySQL database server running with seeded data. Once the user updates the environment variables they can run the application through the command line by entering “npm run start”. Once the server is running the user will have access to endpoints through /api, where they can run CRUD operations.
